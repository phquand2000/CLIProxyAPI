# CLIProxyAPI Plus

English | [Chinese](README_CN.md)

This is the Plus version of [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), adding support for third-party providers on top of the mainline project.

All third-party provider support is maintained by community contributors; CLIProxyAPI does not provide technical support. Please contact the corresponding community maintainer if you need assistance.

The Plus release stays in lockstep with the mainline features.

## Differences from the Mainline

- Added GitHub Copilot support (OAuth login), provided by [em4go](https://github.com/em4go/CLIProxyAPI/tree/feature/github-copilot-auth)
- Added Kiro (AWS CodeWhisperer) support (OAuth login), provided by [fuko2935](https://github.com/fuko2935/CLIProxyAPI/tree/feature/kiro-integration), [Ravens2121](https://github.com/Ravens2121/CLIProxyAPIPlus/)

## New Features (Plus Enhanced)

- **OAuth Web Authentication**: Browser-based OAuth login for Kiro with beautiful web UI
- **Rate Limiter**: Built-in request rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- **Background Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh 10 minutes before expiration
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Request metrics collection for monitoring and debugging
- **Device Fingerprint**: Device fingerprint generation for enhanced security
- **Cooldown Management**: Smart cooldown mechanism for API rate limits
- **Usage Checker**: Real-time usage monitoring and quota management
- **Model Converter**: Unified model name conversion across providers
- **UTF-8 Stream Processing**: Improved streaming response handling
